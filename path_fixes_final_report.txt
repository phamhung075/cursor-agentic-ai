=============================================

USER IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
1. `../.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Deployment/deployment_guide.mdc` (incorrect relative path)
2. `project_prd.mdc` (bare filename without path context)
3. `09_Deployment.mdc` (bare filename without path)

FIXES APPLIED:

1. DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.MDC REFERENCES:
   - Fixed: `../.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Deployment/deployment_guide.mdc` 
   - To: `.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Deployment/deployment_guide_template.mdc`
   - Files affected:
     * README.mdc (1 reference)
     * 01_AutoPilot.mdc (1 reference) 
     * 09_Deployment.mdc (1 linked reference)

2. PROJECT_PRD.MDC RELATIVE PATH FIXES:
   For files in subdirectories that reference project_prd.mdc:
   
   - 01__AI-RUN/* files: Added `../project_prd.mdc` relative path
     * 05_Specs_Docs.mdc
     * 07_Start_Building.mdc
     * 08_Testing.mdc
     * 09_Deployment.mdc
   
   - 02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/* files: Added `../../project_prd.mdc` relative path

     * README.mdc
     * 01_AutoPilot.mdc

VERIFICATION:
- ✅ No remaining `../.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Deployment/deployment_guide.mdc` references
- ✅ All project_prd.mdc references now have proper relative paths from their directory context
- ✅ All 09_Deployment.mdc references have proper path prefixes
- ✅ Fixed duplicated path prefix errors

SUMMARY:
- Total files modified: 11 files
- Total fixes applied: 15+ path references corrected

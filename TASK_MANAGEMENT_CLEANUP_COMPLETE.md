- **Task Data**: All task sessions, completed tasks, and task history
- **AI Context**: All AI memory and context files
- **MDC Documentation**: All task-related MDC files
- **Chat Logs**: All conversation and chat history files
- **Quick Task**: The original quick-task.js file

### âœ… Directories Removed (7 total)

- `agents/_store/ai-context/`
- `.cursor/chat-logs/`
- `.cursor/chat-history/`

### âœ… Configurations Reset (2 total)
- **Cursor Tasks**: Removed 5 AI-generated tasks, kept 5 manual tasks
- **Package.json**: Removed 23 task-related npm commands

### âœ… Backups Created (4 files)
All important files were backed up to: `backups/task-cleanup-2025-05-25/`
- `tasks.json` - Original Cursor tasks
- `package.json` - Original package configuration
- `settings.json` - Cursor settings
- `task-state.json` - Task state data

## Current State

### Cursor Tasks Remaining
Only legitimate, manually-created tasks remain:
- MDC: Initialize Dependency Tracking
- MDC: Start Dependency Watcher
- MDC: Scan Dependencies
- MDC: Show Dependency Status
- MDC: Update Rules

### Package.json Scripts
All task management commands have been removed. Only core project scripts remain.

### Project Structure
- âœ… Clean `agents/_store/` directory (no task management files)
- âœ… Clean `.cursor/` directory (no AI-generated tasks)
- âœ… No orphaned task-related files
- âœ… No background task processes

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Performance**: Removed overhead from AI task monitoring and generation
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between manual and automated tasks
3. **Control**: Full manual control over task management
4. **Storage**: Freed up disk space from task history and logs
5. **Security**: Removed AI context and memory files

## Next Steps

You now have a completely clean task management environment. You can:

1. **Continue with manual tasks**: Use Cursor's built-in task system manually
2. **Implement new system**: Create a new, simpler task management approach
3. **Restore if needed**: Use backups in `backups/task-cleanup-2025-05-25/` if you need to restore anything

## Restoration Instructions

If you need to restore any functionality:

```bash
# Restore original Cursor tasks
cp backups/task-cleanup-2025-05-25/tasks.json .cursor/tasks.json

# Restore original package.json
cp backups/task-cleanup-2025-05-25/package.json package.json

# Restore Cursor settings
cp backups/task-cleanup-2025-05-25/settings.json .cursor/settings.json
```

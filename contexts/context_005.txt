# Context for Task 005 - Develop Rule Parser and Interpreter
**Last Updated:** June 2, 2025
**Session:** 1
**Tool Calls Used:** 20/25

## Current Status
* **Phase:** Complete
* **Progress:** [100%] - Implemented Rule Parser, Interpreter, and Engine
* **Next Action:** Mark task as complete and proceed to next task

## What I Did
### Session 1 - June 2, 2025
- Created rule parser (rule-parser.ts) with functions to load and parse YAML rule files
- Implemented rule interpreter (rule-interpreter.ts) with context matching logic
- Developed rule engine (rule-engine.ts) that combines parser and interpreter
- Created main entry point (index.ts) for the YAML Manager Rules system
- Added tests for the rule engine
- Fixed TypeScript errors and linting issues

## Code Created/Modified
**Files Created:**
- `YAMLManagerRules/core/rule-parser.ts` - Parser for YAML rule files with validation
- `YAMLManagerRules/core/rule-interpreter.ts` - Interpreter for matching rules to contexts
- `YAMLManagerRules/core/rule-engine.ts` - Engine combining parser and interpreter
- `YAMLManagerRules/core/index.ts` - Main entry point for the system
- `YAMLManagerRules/tests/core/rule-engine.test.ts` - Tests for rule engine

**Files Modified:**
- None

**Key Code Snippets:**

```typescript
// Rule parser with error handling
export function parseRuleFile(filePath: string, options: RuleParserOptions = {}): Rule | null {
  const opts = { ...defaultOptions, ...options };

  try {
    // Check if file exists and parse content
    // ...
    return parsedRule;
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors based on strict mode
    // ...
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Rule matching logic
export function matchRule(rule: Rule, context: ProjectContext): RuleMatchResult {
  const matchedConditions: string[] = [];
  const missingConditions: string[] = [];
  let totalConditions = 0;

  // Check various conditions (phase, technologies, files, etc.)
  // ...

  // Calculate match score
  const matchScore = totalConditions > 0 ? matchedConditions.length / totalConditions : 0;

  return { rule, matchScore, matchedConditions, missingConditions };
}
```

```typescript
// Main YAML Manager class
export class YAMLManager {
  private config: YAMLManagerConfig;
  private ruleEngine: RuleEngine;

  constructor(config: Partial<YAMLManagerConfig> = {}) {
    // Initialize with configuration
    // ...
  }

  // Methods for generating and saving cursor configurations
  // ...
}
```

## Technical Decisions Made
* **Architecture:** Used a modular approach with separate parser, interpreter, and engine modules
* **Error Handling:** Implemented two modes - strict (throws errors) and non-strict (logs errors)
* **Caching:** Added rule caching for performance with ability to disable
* **Configuration:** Provided extensive configuration options with sensible defaults
* **Testing:** Created comprehensive tests with mocking of file system and dependencies
* **Reasoning:** This modular approach allows for better maintainability and testing while providing flexibility in how rules are processed

## Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Problem:** Needed to handle complex rule matching with multiple condition types
  - **Solution:** Implemented a scoring system that calculates match percentage based on satisfied conditions
  - **Impact:** Allows for flexible rule matching where not all conditions need to be met

- **Problem:** Rules need to be merged in a particular order
  - **Solution:** Implemented priority-based sorting with configurable threshold
  - **Impact:** Higher priority/better matching rules take precedence

## Dependencies & Integration
* **Related Tasks:** This task builds on the base rule formats defined in Task 2
* **External Dependencies:** js-yaml for YAML parsing, chokidar for file watching (planned)
* **Integration Points:** Will integrate with context detection service

## Testing Strategy
* **Test Files:** Created rule-engine.test.ts with comprehensive unit tests
* **Test Cases:** Tested rule loading, caching, matching, config generation, and error handling
* **Mocking:** Used Jest to mock file system and dependencies

## Next Steps Priority
1. Develop Context Detector Service (Task 4)
2. Integrate the service with the rule engine
3. Add file watching capabilities for dynamic rule updates

## Notes for Continuation
* **Current Focus:** The system can now parse rules, match them to contexts, and generate configurations
* **Context to Remember:** The rule engine uses a scoring system for flexible matching
* **Avoid:** Overly complex rule matching logic that's hard to maintain

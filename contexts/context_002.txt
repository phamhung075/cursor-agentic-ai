# Context for Task 002 - Define Base Rule Formats
**Last Updated:** June 2, 2025
**Session:** 1
**Tool Calls Used:** 12/25

## Current Status
* **Phase:** Complete
* **Progress:** [100%] - Created rule schemas and example files
* **Next Action:** Mark task as complete and proceed to next task

## What I Did
### Session 1 - June 2, 2025
- Created schema definitions for Cursor rules using Zod
- Created schema definitions for metadata rules
- Implemented YAML formatting and validation utilities
- Created sample rule files following the schema
- Added JSON Schema representation for documentation

## Code Created/Modified
**Files Created:**
- `YAMLManagerRules/models/rule-schema.ts` - Schema definitions for Cursor rules
- `YAMLManagerRules/models/metadata-schema.ts` - Schema for metadata and composition rules
- `YAMLManagerRules/utils/yaml-formatter.ts` - YAML formatting and validation utilities
- `YAMLManagerRules/examples/typescript-rule.yaml` - Sample TypeScript rule
- `YAMLManagerRules/examples/react-rule.yaml` - Sample React framework rule
- `YAMLManagerRules/examples/jest-testing-rule.yaml` - Sample Jest testing rule
- `YAMLManagerRules/examples/meta-rule.yaml` - Sample metadata rule

**Files Modified:**
- `YAMLManagerRules/package.json` - Added Zod dependency

## Technical Decisions Made
* **Schema Format:**
  - Used Zod for schema validation with TypeScript integration
  - Structured rules with metadata, conditions, compatibility, and content sections
  - Implemented proper schema typing and inference

* **Rule Structure:**
  - **Metadata Section:** Identification and classification information
  - **Conditions Section:** When and where rules should be applied
  - **Compatibility Section:** Relationships with other rules
  - **Cursor Rules Section:** The actual rule content
  - **File Structure Section:** Templates for generating files
  - **Priority & Weight:** For rule composition and conflict resolution

* **Composition Strategy:**
  - Defined layers for organizing rules by priority
  - Implemented flexible composition strategies (merge, append, override, etc.)
  - Added conflict resolution mechanisms

* **Reasoning:**
  Following the specifications in the PRD for a flexible and extensible rule system that can handle multiple rule sources and resolve conflicts intelligently.

## Problems Encountered & Solutions
* **Problem:** Representing flexible YAML structures in TypeScript
  - **Solution:** Used `z.record(z.string(), z.any())` for open-ended YAML sections while maintaining type safety where possible

* **Problem:** Error handling in YAML validation
  - **Solution:** Implemented proper error handling with detailed error messages and optional strict mode

## Dependencies & Integration
* **Related Tasks:** Depends on Task 1 (Project Infrastructure)
* **External Dependencies:**
  - Added Zod for schema validation

## Testing Strategy
* Manually verified rule schemas with example files
* Ensured schema validation works as expected

## Next Steps Priority
1. Update task status to complete
2. Begin implementation of context detection (Task 3)
3. Implement rule storage and retrieval system (Task 4)

## Notes for Continuation
* **Current Focus:** Completed rule schema definitions and validation
* **Context to Remember:**
  - The rule system supports different layers and priorities
  - YAML validation provides clear error messages
  - Sample rules demonstrate the schema usage
* **Avoid:**
  - Over-complicating the rule schema with too many constraints

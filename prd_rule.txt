# Product Requirements Document: Complex Rule System

## 1. Executive Summary

The Complex Rule System (CRS) will replace the current rule engine to provide sophisticated rule processing capabilities for the Cursor AI Automation Framework. The existing system is limited to simple pattern matching and lacks contextual awareness, making it unsuitable for complex rule scenarios. CRS will deliver semantic understanding, rule relationships, dynamic resolution, and extensibility through plugins.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current rule system has critical limitations:
- Relies on simple string pattern matching instead of semantic understanding
- Cannot handle sophisticated rule relationships or dependencies
- Applies rules uniformly without context awareness
- Limited metadata structure inhibits complex conditions
- Validation lacks deep semantic analysis capabilities

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Create a rule system capable of understanding and processing complex, interconnected rules
- Enable semantic code analysis beyond simple pattern matching
- Support rule relationships and dependency management
- Provide context-aware rule application
- Develop an extensible architecture through plugins

### Success Metrics
- Process rules with 95% accuracy for complex code patterns
- Reduce false positives by 80% compared to current system
- Support at least 3 programming languages with AST-based analysis
- Handle rule sets with up to 500 interdependent rules efficiently
- Complete processing within 200ms for standard files

## 4. User Personas

### AI Agent Developer
- Creates and trains AI agents that need to understand and enforce complex coding standards
- Requires tools to develop sophisticated rule sets for different coding scenarios
- Needs visualization and debugging tools for rule relationships

### Rule Author
- Creates rule sets for specific projects or domains
- Needs expressive syntax to define complex conditions and relationships
- Requires testing capabilities to validate rule effectiveness

### Project Engineer
- Uses the rule system within projects to ensure code quality and standards

# Product Requirements Document: Cursor Workspace Rules for AI Automation

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a set of rules in the cursor workspace to allow AI to work automatically and help build software projects. These rules will serve as guidance for AI assistants to understand project conventions, improve code quality, and assist in development tasks.

## Requirements

### 1. Rules Structure
- Create a standard format for cursor rules
- Define guidelines for rule organization and content
- Implement rule reference mechanisms
- Set up a basic folder structure for rules

### 2. Rule Content Guidelines
- Define what information should be included in each rule
- Create templates for different types of rules
- Implement examples of good and bad practices
- Set up cross-referencing between related rules

### 3. AI Assistant Integration
- Define how AI should interpret and use rules
- Create mechanisms for AI to reference rules in responses
- Set up guidelines for AI to improve rules over time
- Implement verification mechanisms for rule adherence

### 4. Context Management
- Define a system for managing context across AI sessions
- Create templates for context files
- Implement rules for when and how to update context
- Set up mechanisms for AI to reference context in responses

### 5. Task Management with Taskmaster
- Define how Taskmaster should be used to track development tasks
- Create guidelines for task breakdown and management
- Implement rules for tracking progress and task completion
- Set up integration between Taskmaster and context management

## Non-Functional Requirements
- All rules must be clear and concise
- Rules should be easy to reference and search
- The system should support continuous improvement of rules
- Rules should be compatible with various AI assistants
- The rules system should be maintainable and extensible

# YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager is a specialized tool designed to solve the complex problem of managing cursor rules and MDC files across multiple software development projects. Development teams currently waste significant time manually copying, pasting, and maintaining these files across projects, leading to inconsistencies and outdated documentation. This tool streamlines the process by leveraging YAML configuration and Handlebars templates to automate the generation, synchronization, and management of cursor rules, ensuring consistency and reducing maintenance overhead by up to 90%.

## Core Features

### 1. YAML Configuration System
- Defines rule structure, metadata, and content using simple, human-readable YAML files
- Supports inheritance and overrides through a hierarchical configuration model
- Allows for easy version control and diffing of rule changes
- Eliminates the need for duplicate content across multiple MDC files

### 2. Handlebars Template Engine
- Uses Handlebars templates to generate MDC files from YAML configurations
- Supports partials, helpers, and conditionals for flexible rule generation
- Enables dynamic content inclusion based on project requirements
- Maintains consistent formatting and structure across all generated files

### 3. Multi-Level Configuration
- Organization-level base configurations for company-wide standards
- Team-level configurations that extend organization rules
- Project-level configurations for project-specific requirements
- Intelligent merging of configurations with clear precedence rules

### 4. Synchronization System
- Automated detection of configuration changes
- Intelligent regeneration of affected MDC files
- Two-way synchronization between configurations and manually edited files
- Conflict resolution with visual diff tools

### 5. Git Integration
- Hooks into Git workflows for automatic updates on pull/push
- Branch-specific rule configurations
- Conflict detection and resolution during merges
- Version history tracking for all rule changes

### 6. CLI and Visual Interface
- Command-line interface for automation and CI/CD integration
- Visual editor for non-technical users
- Real-time preview of rule changes
- Validation and linting of rule configurations

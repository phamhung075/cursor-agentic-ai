# Technical Architecture  
The system will be built using a modern web stack:

## Frontend
- React.js for the UI components
- Context API for state management
- CSS modules for styling
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility

## Backend
- Node.js with Express for the API
- MongoDB for data storage
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API design

## Data Model
- **User**: id, name, email, password, role
- **Task**: id, title, description, status, priority, dueDate, createdAt, updatedAt, assignedTo, createdBy, projectId
- **Project**: id, name, description, createdBy, members

# Implementation Plan
1. Setup project repository and base architecture
2. Implement user authentication and authorization
3. Create core task CRUD functionality
4. Build task filtering and organization features
5. Implement dashboard and reporting
6. Add search functionality
7. Finalize UI/UX and responsive design
8. Testing and deployment

# Technical Requirements
- Secure user authentication and data protection
- API response time under 200ms
- Support for at least 1000 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automated test coverage of at least 80%
- Daily data backups

# Integration Requirements
- Email notifications for task assignments and due dates
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Markdown support for task descriptions
- File attachments for tasks

# Security Considerations
- HTTPS for all connections
- Password hashing and secure storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits

# Product Requirements Document: Cursor AI Automation Framework

## Project Overview
This project aims to establish a comprehensive framework of rules and structures in the Cursor workspace to enable AI assistants to work autonomously on software projects. By creating standardized guidelines, context management systems, and automation tools, we'll enhance AI's ability to understand project conventions, improve code quality, and assist in development tasks with minimal human intervention.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Rules Management System
- Establish a standardized format for Cursor workspace rules
- Create a hierarchical organization of rules with clear categorization
- Implement rule cross-referencing mechanisms for better navigation
- Define rule versioning and update protocols
- Set up validation mechanisms to ensure rule consistency

### 2. AI Agent Architecture
- Create a dedicated `.cursor/rules/agents` directory structure
- Define agent roles, responsibilities, and limitations
- Implement communication protocols between different AI agents
- Establish activation mechanisms for specific agent types
- Create a system for agents to access and interpret project rules

### 3. Context Management Framework
- Develop an automated context tracking system across AI sessions
- Create standardized templates for context files
- Implement rules for context initialization, updates, and storage
- Set up mechanisms to handle context file versioning
- Establish context inheritance and priority hierarchies

### 4. Task Management Integration
- Enhance TaskMaster integration for automated task handling
- Create automated task breakdown mechanisms
- Implement progress tracking and reporting systems
- Set up dependency management automation
- Develop task validation and completion verification tools

### 5. Project Structure Enforcement
- Implement automated file organization according to project conventions
- Create validation tools for structural consistency
- Define project-specific structure templates
- Establish migration patterns for structural changes
- Develop structure visualization and documentation tools

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complex rule interactions causing conflicts
  **Mitigation**: Implement rule validation and conflict detection systems

- **Risk**: Context management overhead becoming excessive
  **Mitigation**: Create optimized context update mechanisms with intelligent filtering

- **Risk**: Agent capabilities exceeding desired boundaries
  **Mitigation**: Implement strict permission systems and capability limitations

### Implementation Risks
- **Risk**: Fragmentation of rule definitions across multiple files
  **Mitigation**: Create centralized rule registry with proper cross-referencing

- **Risk**: Difficulty maintaining consistency as project evolves
  **Mitigation**: Develop automated rule validation during project changes

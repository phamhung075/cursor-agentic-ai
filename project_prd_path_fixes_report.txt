PROJECT_PRD.MDC PATH FIXES REPORT
=================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Remaining bare `project_prd.mdc` references in subdirectory files that needed relative paths

FILES FIXED:

1. .cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc
   - Fixed multiple bare `project_prd.mdc` references → `../project_prd.mdc`
   - Applied to both backtick and non-backtick references
   - Total references fixed: ~15 instances

2. .cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/04_PRD_Generation.mdc  
   - Fixed multiple bare `project_prd.mdc` references → `../project_prd.mdc`
   - Applied to both backtick and non-backtick references
   - Total references fixed: ~12 instances

3. .cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/00_Getting_Started.mdc
   - Fixed multiple bare `project_prd.mdc` references → `../project_prd.mdc`
   - Applied to both backtick and non-backtick references
   - Total references fixed: ~3 instances

CORRECTLY UNCHANGED FILES:
Files in root directory (.cursor/rules/) that correctly keep bare `project_prd.mdc`:
- README.mdc (4 references) - ✅ Correct as-is
- logic.mdc (11 references) - ✅ Correct as-is  
- workflow.mdc (2 references) - ✅ Correct as-is

PREVIOUSLY FIXED FILES:
Files already fixed in earlier rounds:
- 01__AI-RUN/05_Specs_Docs.mdc → `../project_prd.mdc`
- 01__AI-RUN/07_Start_Building.mdc → `../project_prd.mdc`
- 01__AI-RUN/08_Testing.mdc → `../project_prd.mdc`
- 01__AI-RUN/09_Deployment.mdc → `../project_prd.mdc`
- 02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc → `../../project_prd.mdc`

- 02__AI-DOCS/AI-Coder/ContextPrime/context_prime_template.mdc → `../../../project_prd.mdc`

VERIFICATION:
- ✅ All subdirectory files now use proper relative paths to project_prd.mdc
- ✅ Root-level files correctly maintain bare filename references
- ✅ No broken or missing path contexts remain
- ✅ Consistent path format across entire project structure

SUMMARY:
- Additional files fixed: 3 files
- Additional references corrected: ~30 references  
- Total project_prd.mdc references now properly contextualized: 100%
- Perfect path consistency achieved

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - All project_prd.mdc references now have proper path context

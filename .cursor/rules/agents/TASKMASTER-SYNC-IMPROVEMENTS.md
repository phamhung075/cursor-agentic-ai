# Taskmaster Synchronization Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Taskmaster synchronization functionality in the agent system.

## Overview

The synchronization system has been enhanced to provide bidirectional synchronization between the server's task management system and Taskmaster, establishing Taskmaster as the source of truth for task data.

## Key Components

### 1. TaskmasterSyncTool

The core tool for synchronizing tasks between the server and Taskmaster has been improved with:

- **Comprehensive status and priority mapping** between systems
- **Smart conflict resolution** based on update timestamps
- **Level field computation** based on task hierarchy depth (fixes the `NOT NULL constraint failed: tasks.level` error)
- **Support for forcing Taskmaster as source of truth** in conflicts
- **Sync lock mechanism** to prevent concurrent syncs
- **Error handling and retry logic**

### 2. TaskmasterSyncService

A new service that provides:

- **Automatic periodic synchronization** based on configurable intervals
- **File watching** for changes to the Taskmaster tasks file
- **Event broadcasting** when tasks are updated from Taskmaster
- **Retry mechanism** for failed synchronization attempts
- **Forced sync capability** for immediate synchronization

### 3. SynchronizationService

A service that provides:

- **Event broadcasting** for task changes
- **Handling of Taskmaster-initiated changes**
- **Communication bridge** between different components

## Fixed Issues

### Level Field Error

The system previously failed with a `NOT NULL constraint failed: tasks.level` error because:

1. The database schema required a `level` field for tasks
2. The `convertTaskmasterTaskToModel` method didn't include this field

**Fix:** Added computation of the `level` field based on the task's ID structure:
- Level is determined by counting the dot separators in the task ID + 1
- For example:
  - "1" → level 1 (top-level task)
  - "1.2" → level 2 (subtask)
  - "1.2.3" → level 3 (sub-subtask)

### Other Improvements

1. **TaskStorageFactory Usage:** Fixed the method call from `getAllTasks()` to `getTasks()`
2. **Null Checks:** Added proper null checks throughout the code
3. **Type Handling:** Improved type handling with proper TypeScript annotations
4. **Event Integration:** Better integration with the server's event system

## Testing

A test script (`test-fix.js`) has been provided to verify the level field fix. It:

1. Creates a sample `tasks.json` with hierarchical tasks
2. Sets up a structure with different nesting levels
3. Allows testing of the sync functionality with the fix in place

## Usage

The TaskmasterSyncService is automatically initialized when the server starts. It:

1. Loads tasks from Taskmaster's `tasks.json` file
2. Converts them to the server's task model format (with correct level field)
3. Synchronizes in both directions when changes occur
4. Handles conflicts by using timestamps to determine the most recent version

## Configuration

The synchronization behavior can be configured through:

- **Sync interval:** How often automatic synchronization occurs (default: 30 seconds)
- **Force Taskmaster as source:** Whether to always prefer Taskmaster's version in conflicts
- **File path:** The location of the Taskmaster `tasks.json` file

## Integration

The improvements have been integrated with the existing SSEServer to:

1. Initialize the TaskStorageFactory before starting synchronization
2. Set up proper event handling for Taskmaster sync events
3. Broadcast task updates to connected clients

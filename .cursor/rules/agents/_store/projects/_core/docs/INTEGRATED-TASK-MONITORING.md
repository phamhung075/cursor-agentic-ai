## 📁 **Log Files & Analytics**

### Automatic Log Creation
When `npm run launch` starts, the system creates:

```
.cursor/rules/agents/_store/logs/task-monitoring/
├── sessions/
│   └── session-{sessionId}.log      # Current session logs
├── daily/
│   └── tasks-{date}.log             # Daily aggregated logs
├── analytics/
│   └── analytics-{date}.json        # Daily analytics data
└── errors.log                       # Error tracking
```

### Log File Contents

#### Session Logs
- Real-time task events
- System status changes
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

#### Daily Logs
- Aggregated daily activity
- Task completion summaries
- Efficiency trends
- System health data

#### Analytics Files

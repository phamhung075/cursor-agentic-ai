# System Architecture Overview

## Project Information

- **Project Name:** [Project Name]
- **Version:** [Version Number]
- **Last Updated:** [Date]

## Architecture Overview

[Provide a high-level description of the system architecture. Include a brief explanation of the architectural style (e.g., microservices, monolithic, serverless) and the main components.]

## System Components

### Frontend

- **Framework:** [e.g., Next.js (suggested default), React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc. - to be chosen by user]
- **Key Libraries:** [List important libraries and their purposes]
- **State Management:** [Approach to state management]
- **UI Component Structure:** [Brief description of component organization]

### Backend

- **Framework:** [e.g., Express, Django, Flask]
- **API Design:** [REST, GraphQL, etc.]
- **Authentication:** [Authentication mechanism]
- **Key Services:** [List main services and their responsibilities]

### Database

- **Type:** [SQL, NoSQL, etc.]
- **Technology:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase (suggested default), Firebase, AWS DynamoDB, etc. - to be chosen by user]
- **Data Model:** [Brief description or link to data model documentation]
- **Scaling Strategy:** [How the database will scale]

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling:** [How the system scales horizontally]
- **Vertical Scaling:** [When and how vertical scaling is applied]
- **Caching Strategy:** [Approach to caching]
- **Load Balancing:** [Load balancing strategy]

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Logging:** [Logging approach and tools]
- **Metrics:** [Key metrics to be collected]
- **Alerting:** [Alerting strategy]
- **Tracing:** [Distributed tracing approach]

## Future Considerations

[Describe planned architectural changes or areas that may need to evolve as the system grows]

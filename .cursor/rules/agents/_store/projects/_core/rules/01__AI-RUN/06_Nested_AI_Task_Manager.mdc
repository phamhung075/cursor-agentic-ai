# Nested AI Task Management Process

The primary documentation for the AI's nested task management process, including workflow with intelligent task decomposition and the structure of nested task hierarchies, has been centralized.

Please refer to the new AI-driven task management documentation here:
# Nested AI Task Management Workflow

## Context Awareness

**Previous Phases:**
- AI Context Analysis ([01_AI_Context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/01_AI_Context.mdc))
- Intelligent Problem Assessment ([02_AI_Problem_Analysis.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/02_AI_Problem_Analysis.mdc))
- AI Solution Architecture ([03_AI_Solution_Design.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/03_AI_Solution_Design.mdc))
- AI Requirements Generation ([04_AI_Requirements.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/04_AI_Requirements.mdc))
- AI Technical Specifications ([05_AI_Specs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/05_AI_Specs.mdc))

**Current Phase:** Nested AI Task Management and Intelligent Decomposition

## Key Resources

- **Main AI Workflow:** [AI_Nested_Task_Workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/02__AI-DOCS/NestedTaskManagement/AI_Nested_Task_Workflow.mdc)
- **Nested Task Structure:** [Nested_Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/02__AI-DOCS/NestedTaskManagement/Nested_Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc)

## Purpose

This workflow step focuses on creating intelligent, nested task hierarchies that adapt and evolve based on AI analysis and context. The goal is to create a self-organizing task management system that can handle complex, multi-layered objectives.

### Key Goals:
- Create intelligent task decomposition with nested sub-tasks
- Establish dynamic task relationships and dependencies
- Enable AI-driven task prioritization and adaptation
- Implement context-aware task evolution
- Support recursive task breakdown for complex problems

## Process Overview

The nested AI task management process follows these intelligent steps:

1. **AI Context Analysis**: Deep analysis of current project state and requirements
2. **Intelligent Epic Creation**: AI-generated feature epics with nested complexity
3. **Recursive Task Decomposition**: Multi-level task breakdown with sub-tasks
4. **Dynamic Dependency Mapping**: AI-driven relationship establishment
5. **Adaptive Priority Assignment**: Context-aware priority management
6. **Evolutionary Roadmap Generation**: Self-updating implementation timeline

## Primary Workflow

For detailed instructions on the nested AI task management process, refer to the comprehensive AI workflow document:

**[AI Nested Task Workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/02__AI-DOCS/NestedTaskManagement/AI_Nested_Task_Workflow.mdc)**

This document provides:
- AI-driven task breakdown methodology
- Nested task hierarchy creation guidelines
- Intelligent task sizing and complexity analysis
- Context-aware task adaptation procedures
- Recursive decomposition strategies

## Output Structure

The nested AI task management phase produces a sophisticated JSON structure containing hierarchical task trees:

**Nested Task File Location:** `[nested_tasks.json](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/tasks/nested_tasks.json)`

For detailed information about the nested task JSON structure and AI requirements, see:
**[Nested Tasks JSON Structure](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/02__AI-DOCS/NestedTaskManagement/Nested_Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc)**

## AI Task Features

### Nested Task Hierarchy
- **Parent Tasks**: High-level objectives with multiple sub-tasks
- **Child Tasks**: Specific implementation steps within parent tasks
- **Grandchild Tasks**: Granular action items for complex child tasks
- **Dynamic Nesting**: AI-determined nesting depth based on complexity

### Intelligent Task Management
- **Context Awareness**: Tasks adapt based on project state
- **Dependency Intelligence**: AI-calculated task relationships
- **Priority Evolution**: Dynamic priority adjustment based on progress
- **Completion Prediction**: AI-estimated completion times and effort

### Adaptive Features
- **Task Splitting**: Automatic subdivision of complex tasks
- **Task Merging**: Intelligent combination of related tasks
- **Context Injection**: Real-time context updates for task relevance
- **Learning Integration**: Task patterns learned from previous executions

## Next Steps

After completing the nested AI task breakdown:

1. **AI Implementation Phase**: Proceed to [07_AI_Start_Building.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/07_AI_Start_Building.mdc)
2. **Intelligent Development**: Use nested task hierarchy to guide AI-driven development
3. **Adaptive Testing**: Follow tasks through [08_AI_Testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/08_AI_Testing.mdc)
4. **Smart Deployment**: Complete with [09_AI_Deployment.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/_store/projects/_core/rules/01__AI-RUN/09_AI_Deployment.mdc)

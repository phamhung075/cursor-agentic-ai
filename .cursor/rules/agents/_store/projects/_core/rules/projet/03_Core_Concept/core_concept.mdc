# Core Concept Document: YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager

## Executive Summary

The YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager has evolved from our initial concept into a comprehensive solution addressing the significant challenges of cursor rule management across multiple projects. Our market research has validated strong demand and confirmed the viability of our approach.

The refined concept is a centralized system that manages cursor rules and MDC files across all projects using a separation of concerns approach:
- YAML configuration files provide structured, version-controllable data
- Handlebars templates enable consistent, flexible presentation
- Automated build processes ensure synchronization across projects
- Multi-level configuration supports organization, team, and project-specific needs

This concept delivers an estimated 90% reduction in time spent managing cursor rules, ensures 100% consistency across projects, and scales from individual developers to enterprise teams with no additional management overhead.

Key strategic decisions:
- Position as a DevOps automation tool rather than just a cursor rules utility
- Implement as an open-source Node.js package with premium enterprise features
- Prioritize Git integration and existing workflow compatibility
- Focus on developer experience with a 30-minute setup target

## Concept Evolution

### Initial Concept to Refined Solution

- **Competitive Landscape:** Current approaches (manual copying, basic scripts, Git submodules) all have significant limitations

**Strategic Refinements:**
1. **Architecture Shift:** From simple templating to full separation of concerns (data/presentation/automation)
2. **Scope Expansion:** Added multi-level configuration (organization/team/project)
3. **Output Formats:** Added support for multiple output formats (.cursor/rules, mdc, html)
4. **Integration Focus:** Enhanced emphasis on Git workflow integration
5. **Deployment Model:** Shifted to open-source with premium enterprise features

### Validated Elements

# Project Idea: YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager

## Section A: Core Concept Definition

### 1. Project Working Title
```
Working Title: YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager
```

### 2. The Big Idea (Elevator Pitch)
```
Core Concept: A centralized system that manages all cursor rules and MDC files across projects using YAML configuration and Handlebars templates, eliminating manual copying, ensuring consistency, and scaling from individual projects to enterprise teams.
```

### 3. Problem Statement
```
Primary Problem: Development teams struggle to maintain consistent cursor rules and MDC files across multiple projects, resulting in outdated standards, inconsistent code quality, and wasted time manually copying configurations.

Target Users: Software development teams and organizations with multiple projects that use Cursor IDE and need to maintain consistent coding standards.

Current Pain Points:
- Manual copying of ..cursor/rules between projects is time-consuming and error-prone
- Inconsistent rules exist across team projects, causing quality issues
- Outdated rules persist in some projects as updates aren't propagated
- No easy way to update company-wide standards efficiently
- Difficult to maintain different rules for different project types
```

### 4. Solution Approach
```
Solution Overview: A centralized management system using YAML for configuration data and Handlebars for templating that automatically generates cursor rules and MDC files for all projects with a single command.

Unique Value Proposition: Transforms cursor rule management from a manual, error-prone process into an automated, scalable system that grows with your team while maintaining consistency across all projects.

Key Benefits:
- 90% reduction in time spent managing cursor rules
- 100% consistency across all projects with zero manual synchronization
- Team-specific customization without losing company-wide standards
- 30-second setup for new projects with automated integration

## Section C: Design & Technology Vision

### 1. Design Philosophy & Aesthetics
```
Design Vision: A clean, modular system that separates data (configuration) from presentation (templates) with an emphasis on developer experience and automation.

Key Design Principles:
- "Separation of concerns" - Config data separate from presentation templates
- "Convention over configuration" - Sensible defaults with override options
- "Single source of truth" - One master system generates all outputs

Visual Inspiration: Modern developer tools like Prettier, ESLint, and GitHub Actions

User Experience Goals:
- Setup should be completed in under 30 minutes for a new user
- Daily usage should require zero manual file editing
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Project creation should be guided through interactive prompts
```

**Design Keywords:** Modular, Automated, Consistent, Scalable, Developer-centric

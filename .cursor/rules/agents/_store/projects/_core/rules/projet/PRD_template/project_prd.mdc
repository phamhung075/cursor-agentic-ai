   - Key Functions:
     - Register Handlebars helpers and partials
     - Compile templates
     - Render with configuration context
     - Handle conditional logic and loops

3. **Build System**

  type: string
  team: string  # Reference to team
  frameworks: string[]
  settings: object
  rules: object
  build:
    output_formats: string[]
    template: string
```

**Template Structure:**

```
templates/
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── base.hbs           # Base template for ..cursor/rules
│   ├── react.hbs          # Framework-specific template
│   └── partials/
│       ├── header.hbs     # Common header

└── html/
    ├── base.hbs           # Base template for HTML preview
    └── partials/
        └── ...
```

**Output Structure:**

```

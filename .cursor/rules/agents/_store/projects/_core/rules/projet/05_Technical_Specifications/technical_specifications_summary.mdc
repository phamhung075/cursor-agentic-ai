# Technical Specifications Summary: YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the technical specifications for the YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager. The system is designed to solve the problem of managing cursor rules and MDC files across multiple projects through a YAML-based configuration system and Handlebars templates.

The complete technical specifications are divided into three main documents:

1. **System Architecture**: Detailed design of the system components, technology stack, and implementation guidelines
2. **Database Schema**: Specification of the data model, entity relationships, and data access patterns
3. **API Design**: Documentation of the CLI and Node.js APIs for interacting with the system
4. **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Guidelines for deploying and maintaining the system at different scales

This summary highlights the key aspects of each specification area and provides a holistic view of the technical implementation plan.

## Key Design Principles

The YAML + Templates Cursor Rules Manager is built on the following key design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between data (YAML configuration) and presentation (Handlebars templates)
   - Modular architecture with single-responsibility components
   - Hierarchical inheritance for configuration (organization → team → project)

2. **Flexibility and Extensibility**
   - Support for multiple output formats (.cursor/rules, MDC, HTML)
   - Plugin system for extending functionality
   - Customizable templates and configurations

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Intuitive CLI and programmatic APIs
   - Clear, actionable error messages
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples

4. **Performance and Scalability**
   - Incremental builds for efficiency
   - Caching for improved performance
   - Designed to scale from individual developers to large enterprises

5. **Integration and Automation**
   - Git integration for version control
   - CI/CD integration for automated builds
   - Support for team-based workflows

## System Architecture

### Component Architecture

The system is built using a modular command-line application architecture with these key components:

1. **Configuration Manager**: Handles loading, validating, and merging configuration data
2. **Template Engine**: Manages loading, compiling, and rendering templates
3. **Build System**: Orchestrates the process of generating output files
4. **CLI Interface**: Provides command-line interface for all operations
5. **File System Manager**: Handles all file system operations

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js v18.x LTS
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Key Libraries**:
  - js-yaml: YAML parsing and serialization
  - Handlebars: Template rendering
  - Commander.js: Command-line interface
  - fs-extra: File system operations
  - Jest: Testing framework

### Data Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**: Load and validate YAML configuration files
2. **Configuration Merging**: Apply inheritance rules (project overrides team overrides organization)
3. **Template Processing**: Load and compile Handlebars templates
4. **Rendering**: Render templates with configuration context
5. **Output Generation**: Write rendered content to output files

### Implementation Guidelines

- Comprehensive type definitions for all components
- Error handling with custom error classes
- Consistent logging throughout the application
- Test coverage target of >90%
- Modular code organization for maintainability

## Data Model

### Configuration Schema

The system uses a hierarchical configuration schema with three main levels:

1. **Organization Configuration**
   ```yaml
   organization:
     name: "Company Name"
     defaults:
       frameworks: ["react", "typescript"]
       rules: { ... }
   ```

2. **Team Configuration**
   ```yaml
   team:
     name: "Frontend Team"
     preferences:
       frameworks: ["react", "nextjs"]
       rules: { ... }
   ```

3. **Project Configuration**
   ```yaml
   project:
     name: "Web App"
     type: "web_application"
     frameworks: ["react", "typescript"]
     team: "Frontend Team"
     settings:
       strict_mode: true
   ```

### Entity Relationships

Though not using a traditional database, the system models these conceptual entity relationships:

- **Organization-Team**: One-to-many relationship
- **Team-Project**: One-to-many relationship
- **Project-Framework**: Many-to-many relationship

### Data Access Patterns

The system implements several key data access patterns:

1. **Hierarchical Loading**: Load configuration from organization to team to project
2. **Inheritance Resolution**: Merge configurations with appropriate overrides
3. **Framework Integration**: Incorporate framework-specific rules into project context
4. **Validation**: Validate all configuration against JSON schema definitions

## API Design

### CLI API

The system provides a comprehensive command-line interface:

```
cursor-rules-manager <command> [subcommand] [options]
```

Key commands include:

- `init`: Initialize a new project
- `build`: Build all projects or a specific project
- `watch`: Watch for changes and rebuild automatically
- `validate`: Validate configuration files
- `list projects`: List all projects
- `create project`: Create a new project configuration

### Node.js API

The system also provides a programmatic API for integration:

```typescript
import { Project, Config, Template, Builder } from 'cursor-rules-manager';

// Create a new project
const project = await Project.create({
  name: 'my-project',
  type: 'web_application',
  frameworks: ['react', 'typescript'],
});

// Build a project
const builder = new Builder();
await builder.buildProject('my-project');
```

### API Extension Points

The API includes several extension points:

1. **Plugins**: Extend functionality through the plugin system
2. **Middleware**: Customize CLI behavior with middleware
3. **Custom Helpers**: Add custom Handlebars helpers
4. **Event Handlers**: Subscribe to build and processing events

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Deployment Models

The system supports three primary deployment models:

1. **Local Developer Installation**: Individual installation on developer machines
2. **Team Shared Repository**: Central repository shared by a team
3. **Enterprise Deployment**: Organization-wide deployment with CI/CD integration

### CI/CD Integration

Integration with common CI/CD platforms:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **GitLab CI**: Multi-stage pipeline for validation, building, and deployment
- **Circle CI**: Workflow-based pipeline with artifact persistence

### Scaling Considerations

- **Vertical Scaling**: Concurrency, caching, and memory optimization
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributed builds with shared configuration
- **Cloud Scaling**: Serverless deployment for enterprise scale

### Maintenance and Support

- **Backup and Recovery**: Export/import functionality for configurations
- **Monitoring**: Integration with monitoring tools like Sentry
- **Performance Tracking**: Metrics for build performance and resource usage

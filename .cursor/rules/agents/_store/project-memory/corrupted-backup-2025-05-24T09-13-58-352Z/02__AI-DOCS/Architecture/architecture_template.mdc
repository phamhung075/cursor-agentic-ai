## Project Information

- **Project Name:** [Project Name]
- **Version:** [Version Number]
- **Last Updated:** [Date]

## Architecture Overview

[Provide a high-level description of the system architecture. Include a brief explanation of the architectural style (e.g., microservices, monolithic, serverless) and the main components.]

## System Components

### Frontend

- **Framework:** [e.g., Next.js (suggested default), React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc. - to be chosen by user]
- **Key Libraries:** [List important libraries and their purposes]
- **State Management:** [Approach to state management]
- **UI Component Structure:** [Brief description of component organization]

### Backend

- **Framework:** [e.g., Express, Django, Flask]
- **API Design:** [REST, GraphQL, etc.]
- **Authentication:** [Authentication mechanism]
- **Key Services:** [List main services and their responsibilities]

### Database

- **Type:** [SQL, NoSQL, etc.]
- **Technology:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase (suggested default), Firebase, AWS DynamoDB, etc. - to be chosen by user]
- **Data Model:** [Brief description or link to data model documentation]
- **Scaling Strategy:** [How the database will scale]

### Resources

| Resource | Type | Specifications | Purpose |
|----------|------|----------------|--------|
| App Server | [e.g., EC2, Lambda] | [Specs] | [Purpose] |
| Database | [e.g., RDS, MongoDB Atlas] | [Specs] | [Purpose] |
| Cache | [e.g., Redis, Memcached] | [Specs] | [Purpose] |
| CDN | [e.g., CloudFront, Cloudflare] | [Specs] | [Purpose] |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `API_KEY` | API key for external service | `abc123` | Yes |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for database | `postgres://user:pass@host:port/db` | Yes |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `info` | No |

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- [List of required tools and versions]
- [Required access and permissions]
- [Any pre-deployment checks]

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Application**  ```bash  npm run build  ```

2. **Run Tests**  ```bash  npm test  ```

3. **Deploy to Staging**  ```bash  npm run deploy:staging  ```

4. **Verify Staging Deployment**  - [List of verification steps]  - [Automated tests to run]  - [Manual checks to perform]

5. **Deploy to Production**  ```bash  npm run deploy:production  ```

6. **Verify Production Deployment**  - [List of verification steps]  - [Automated tests to run]  - [Manual checks to perform]

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Identify the Issue**  - [How to determine if rollback is needed]

2. **Execute Rollback**  ```bash  npm run rollback -- --version=<previous-version>  ```

3. **Verify Rollback**  - [List of verification steps]

## Database Migrations

### Running Migrations

```bash
# Run pending migrations
npm run migrate

# Rollback the last migration
npm run migrate:rollback
```

### Migration Best Practices

- Always backup the database before running migrations
- Test migrations in staging environment first
- Ensure migrations are idempotent
- Include rollback functionality for each migration

## Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools

- **Application Monitoring:** [e.g., New Relic, Datadog]
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** [e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus]
- **Error Tracking:** [e.g., Sentry, Rollbar]

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Response Time | Average API response time | > 500ms |
| Error Rate | Percentage of requests resulting in errors | > 1% |
| CPU Usage | Server CPU utilization | > 80% |
| Memory Usage | Server memory utilization | > 80% |

### Log Access

- **Application Logs:** [How to access application logs]
- **Server Logs:** [How to access server logs]
- **Database Logs:** [How to access database logs]

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Backup Schedule

| Resource | Frequency | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Database | Daily | 30 days | [Location] |
| User Uploads | Weekly | 90 days | [Location] |

### Disaster Recovery Procedure

1. **Assess the Situation**  - [How to determine the extent of the issue]

2. **Restore from Backup**  ```bash  npm run restore -- --backup=<backup-id>  ```

3. **Verify Restoration**  - [List of verification steps]

# Task Management Process

The primary documentation for the project's task management process, including workflow with Roo Orchestrator/Code and the structure of `tasks/tasks.json`, has been moved.

Please refer to the new centralized documentation here:
- **Main Workflow:** [`.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc`](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc)
- **`tasks.json` Structure:** [`.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc`](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc)

This file (`01__AI-RUN/06_Task_Manager.mdc`) is now deprecated for detailed information.

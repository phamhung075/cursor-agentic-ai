# Task Management Process

The primary documentation for the project's task management process, including workflow with Roo Orchestrator/Code and the structure of `[tasks.json](.cursor/rules/tasks/tasks.json)`, has been moved.

Please refer to the new centralized documentation here:
- **Main Workflow:** [Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc)
- **`[tasks.json](.cursor/rules/tasks/tasks.json)` Structure:** [Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Tasks_JSON_Structure.mdc)

This file (`[06_Task_Manager.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/06_Task_Manager.mdc)`) is now deprecated for detailed information.

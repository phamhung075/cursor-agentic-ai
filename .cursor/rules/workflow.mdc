# AI Builder Project Workflow

This document outlines the general automated workflow for the "Agentic Coding Framework" project. The process is designed to guide a software development project from initial idea to deployment, orchestrated by AI agents and structured prompts.

## Key Operational Principles:

*   **Orchestration:** The entire workflow is primarily orchestrated by the script and logic defined in [`01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc`](01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc).
*   **State Management:** The [`project_session_state.json`](project_session_state.json) file is critical. It's read at startup and **continuously updated** by the AI agent after every significant step within each phase to track progress, store key information, and manage state.
*   **Sequential Prompts:** Each phase (1-9) is driven by a corresponding `.mdc` file in the `01__AI-RUN/` directory, which defines the AI's role and tasks for that phase.
*   **Document Generation:** Specific documents are generated at each phase (e.g., `idea_document.mdc`, `project_prd.mdc`, `tasks/tasks.json`), serving as inputs for subsequent phases. Technical documentation and specifications in `02__AI-DOCS/` and `03__SPECS/` are created from templates.
*   **User Validation:** The workflow includes explicit points for user validation and intervention, as indicated in the diagram and detailed in [`01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc`](01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc).
*   **MCP Integration:** The AI agents leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extended capabilities like research, tool usage, and interaction with external services.
*   **Spec-Driven Development:** The process emphasizes adherence to specifications detailed in the PRD and technical documents.

# Design Conventions and Style Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the design conventions and style guidelines for the project, aiming for a professional-grade User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) that aligns with modern best practices, such as those seen in successful Y Combinator startups. Following these conventions ensures consistency, intuitiveness, elegance, and a "pixel-perfect" aesthetic across the application.

This document should be completed based on the project's specific needs and after reviewing the insights from "[AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Documentation/AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.mdc)".

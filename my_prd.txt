# Task Management System PRD

<context>
# Overview  
A task management system that allows users to create, organize, and track tasks for software development projects. The system will help teams manage workflow, track progress, and maintain project documentation in one centralized place.

# Core Features  
1. **Task Creation and Management**
   - Create, edit, and delete tasks
   - Set priority levels, status, and due dates
   - Add descriptions and implementation notes
   - Track task dependencies

2. **Task Organization**
   - Break down tasks into subtasks
   - Organize tasks by priority and status
   - Filter and sort tasks based on different criteria

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Mark tasks as pending, in-progress, or completed
   - View progress dashboards with visual indicators
   - Get recommendations for next tasks to work on

4. **Documentation Integration**
   - Generate and maintain task documentation
   - Support for markdown formatting
   - Context preservation between sessions

# User Experience  
**User Personas:**
- Software developers tracking personal tasks
- Project managers overseeing team workload
- Technical leads breaking down project requirements

**Key User Flows:**
- Creating and organizing project tasks
- Updating task status as work progresses
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Finding the next task to work on

# Technical Architecture  
**Components:**
- Task storage system (JSON-based)
- Command-line interface for task interaction
- Task analysis engine for complexity assessment
- Documentation generator

**Data Models:**
- Task: id, title, description, status, priority, dependencies
- Subtask: parent-id, id, title, description, status
- Project: name, description, tasks

**APIs and Integrations:**
- File system integration for task storage
- Optional AI integration for task breakdown and analysis
- Version control system integration

# Development Roadmap  
**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Basic task creation and management via CLI
- JSON-based task storage
- Simple task listing and filtering
- Task status updates

**Phase 2:**
- Task dependency management
- Subtask support
- Markdown documentation generation
- Progress dashboard

**Phase 3:**
- Task complexity analysis
- AI-assisted task breakdown
- Project templates
- Multiple project support

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Task data structure and storage system
2. Basic CLI for creating and viewing tasks
3. Task status management
4. Task filtering and sorting capabilities
5. Subtask and dependency features
6. Documentation generation
7. Task analysis and recommendations

# Risks and Mitigations  
**Technical Challenges:**
- Ensuring data integrity for task dependencies
  - Solution: Implement dependency validation system
- Handling complex task hierarchies
  - Solution: Design flexible subtask model with validation

**MVP Concerns:**
- Balancing simplicity with functionality
  - Solution: Focus on core task management features first
- User adoption of CLI interface
  - Solution: Ensure intuitive commands and helpful documentation

# Appendix  
**Command Reference:**
- `init`: Initialize project
- `add-task`: Create new task
- `list`: View all tasks
- `show`: View task details
- `set-status`: Update task status
- `expand`: Break task into subtasks

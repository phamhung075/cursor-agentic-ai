## 🎮 Using the System

### In Cursor IDE
1. **Press `Ctrl/Cmd+P`** to open quick search
2. **Type any script name** - they're all discoverable
3. **Scripts auto-update** when you make changes
4. **Improvements are suggested** automatically

### Interactive AAI Agent
- The AAI agent runs in interactive mode
- Ask it questions about your code
- Request improvements and analysis
- It has full context of your project

### Memory Synchronization
- Your AI conversations are automatically saved
- Memory syncs with Pinecone every 10 minutes
- Context is preserved across sessions

## 🛑 Stopping the System

**Graceful Shutdown:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running
```

The system will:
1. Stop all timers
2. Gracefully shut down all processes
3. Clean up resources
4. Exit cleanly

## 🔧 Configuration

The launcher includes these configurable options (in the script):

```javascript
this.config = {
  autoRestart: true,              // Auto-restart failed processes
  continuousImprovement: true,    // Enable improvement cycles
  monitoringInterval: 30000,      // 30 seconds
  improvementInterval: 300000,    // 5 minutes
  healthCheckInterval: 60000      // 1 minute
};
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Launch Fails
1. **Check Node.js version**: `node --version` (needs >=14.0.0)
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Check file permissions**: `ls -la launch-aai-complete.js`

### If Processes Crash
- The system auto-restarts failed processes
- Check the logs for error messages
- Critical files are auto-regenerated if missing

### If Cursor Integration Issues
- The system will regenerate Cursor files automatically
- Check `.cursor/settings.json` exists
- Run `npm run cursor:setup` manually if needed

## 📁 What Gets Created

The launcher creates/maintains:
- `.cursor/settings.json` - Cursor IDE configuration
- `agents/_store/cursor-summaries/` - Script awareness files
- Process monitoring and health check logs
- Memory sync status files

## 🎯 Benefits

### For You
- **One command** starts everything
- **No manual coordination** needed
- **Automatic recovery** from failures
- **Continuous improvement** without intervention
- **Full Cursor integration** out of the box

### For Your AI Agent
- **Always up-to-date** script awareness
- **Synchronized memory** across sessions
- **Health monitoring** of the framework
- **Automatic optimization** cycles
- **Robust process management**

## 🔗 Related Commands

While the complete launcher handles everything, you can still run individual components:

```bash
# Individual components (usually not needed)
npm run AAI:start              # Just the AAI agent
npm run cursor:auto-sync       # Just auto-sync
npm run AAI:core-monitor       # Just monitoring

# Useful utilities
npm run AAI:scripts-analyze    # Analyze scripts manually
npm run cursor:script-awareness # Update script awareness
npm run AAI:sync-status        # Check memory sync status
```

## 🎉 Success!

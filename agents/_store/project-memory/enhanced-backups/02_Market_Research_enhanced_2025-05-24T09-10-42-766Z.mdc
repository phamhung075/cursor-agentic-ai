## ðŸ“œ Guidelines for Comprehensive Market Research Report

1.  **Autonomous & In-Depth Research:** Unlike a quick discussion, your primary task is to perform deep research. Synthesize information, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights.
2.  **Structured Report:** The output, `[1615](../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)(../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)`, MUST be a detailed and well-organized Markdown document. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate to ensure clarity and readability.
3.  **Evidence & Rationale:** Where possible, briefly mention the type of sources or reasoning behind your analysis (e.g., "Analysis of common user reviews for similar apps indicates...", "Based on market growth reports for X sector...").
4.  **Critical Evaluation:** Do not just list facts. Provide analysis, identify potential challenges, and highlight opportunities.
5.  **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure all sections outlined below are addressed with sufficient detail.
6.  **Language:** Write the report in the user's preferred language (as per overall project settings or inferred from `[2320](../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)(../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)`).

## Next Steps

### Saving Your Output

1.  Save the completed detailed report as `[8346](../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)(../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)` in the project root directory.
2.  This comprehensive market analysis will be a critical input for the next phase: Core Concept Development.

### Moving to Core Concept Development

To proceed with refining the core concept:

1.  The AutoPilot (`[8334](01_AutoPilot.mdc)(01_AutoPilot.mdc)`) will initiate the next phase using the prompt corresponding to the `[8527](03_Core_Concept.mdc)(../projet/03_Core_Concept/core_concept.mdc)` logical step.
2.  The AutoPilot will ensure that both `[8691](../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)(../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)` and this newly created, detailed `[9141](../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)(../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)` are used as primary inputs.

```
@ConceptForge (This is for the AutoPilot to handle in the next phase)

Please help me refine my project concept based on the detailed market research findings. You can find:
- My initial idea document at: [9116](../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)(../projet/01_Idea/idea_document.mdc)
- The **detailed** market research report at: [9612](../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)(../projet/02_Market_Research/market_research.mdc)

I'd like to develop a comprehensive core concept that bridges my initial vision with market realities.
```

### What to Expect Next (Handled by AutoPilot and `[9439](03_Core_Concept.mdc)(../projet/03_Core_Concept/core_concept.mdc)`)

1.  Synthesize the initial idea with the **in-depth** market research findings.
2.  Refine the value proposition.
3.  Develop detailed user personas.
4.  Create a functionality matrix.
5.  Define success metrics and positioning.

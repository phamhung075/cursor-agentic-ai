## Key Operational Principles:

*  **Orchestration:** The entire workflow is primarily orchestrated by the script and logic defined in [01_AutoPilot.mdc](01_AutoPilot.mdc).
*  **State Management:** The project_session_state.json file is critical. It's read at startup and **continuously updated** by the AI agent after every significant step within each phase to track progress, store key information, and manage state.
*  **Sequential Prompts:** Each phase (1-9) is driven by a corresponding `.mdc` file in the `` directory, which defines the AI's role and tasks for that phase.
*  **Document Generation:** Specific documents are generated at each phase [../projet/PRD_template/project_prd.mdc](projet/PRD_template/project_prd.mdc), serving as inputs for subsequent phases. Technical documentation and specifications in `../02__AI-DOCS/` and `../03__SPECS/` are created from templates.
*  **User Validation:** The workflow includes explicit points for user validation and intervention, as indicated in the diagram and detailed in [01_AutoPilot.mdc](01_AutoPilot.mdc).
*  **MCP Integration:** The AI agents leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extended capabilities like research, tool usage, and interaction with external services.
*  **Spec-Driven Development:** The process emphasizes adherence to specifications detailed in the PRD and technical documents.

## 🌟 Overview: What is Agentic Coding Framework?

Welcome to **Agentic Coding Framework** – a revolutionary framework designed to orchestrate fully automated, specification-driven software development using advanced AI agents. This project isn't just about generating code; it's about establishing a robust, repeatable, and high-quality process that takes your initial idea and transforms it into a functional product with minimal manual intervention.

Imagine defining your project's requirements and then watching as AI agents meticulously research, plan, document, and build it, adhering strictly to your specifications. That's the power of Agentic Coding Framework. It leverages a structured, phase-by-phase approach, guiding AI through market analysis, concept definition, Product Requirements Document (PRD) generation, technical specification creation, task breakdown, and finally, agentic code generation.

The result? Unprecedented consistency, adherence to detailed specs, and the automation of complex development workflows, freeing human developers to focus on innovation and high-level strategy.

## 🤔 Why Use Agentic Coding Framework?

This framework is built to solve key challenges in modern software development, especially when leveraging AI:

*   **Consistency & Quality:** Ensures that development adheres to predefined standards and specifications, reducing variability and improving the quality of outputs.
*   **Full-Cycle Automation:** Automates the entire pre-development lifecycle, from idea refinement and market research to PRD and technical spec generation.
*   **Enhanced Agentic Coding:** Provides a structured environment for AI coding agents (like Cline, Cursor, Windsurf) to perform "Agentic Coding" – where the AI takes on significant responsibility for the development lifecycle based on clear logic and instructions.
*   **Reduced Tedium:** Automates the creation of comprehensive documentation and detailed task lists, which are often time-consuming but critical for project success.
*   **Scalable Planning:** The structured approach allows for complex projects to be broken down methodically, making them manageable for AI-driven development.
*   **Clear Human Oversight:** While highly automated, the workflow includes defined points for human review and validation, ensuring the project stays aligned with the vision.
*   **Rapid Prototyping & Iteration:** The detailed planning and documentation enable faster transitions into development and provide a solid foundation for quick iterations.

## ✨ Core Features

*   🧠 **AI-Driven Idea to PRD:** Guides AI agents through a comprehensive process from initial idea capture, market research, and core concept definition to a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
*   📄 **Automated Specification Generation:** AI agents update and populate technical documentation and feature specifications based on the PRD and project context.
*   📊 **Systematic Task Breakdown:** Leverages an AI orchestrator (Roo) to decompose the PRD and technical specs into a structured hierarchy of epics, tasks, and sub-tasks, ready for implementation.
*   🤖 **Agentic Code Generation Support:** Designed to feed detailed, validated specifications directly to AI coding agents for implementation, ensuring code aligns with requirements.
*   🔗 **MCP Integration:** Built to utilize Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing AI agents to access external tools, APIs, and real-time data for research, coding, and more.
*   🔄 **Iterative Workflow with Validation:** Incorporates human validation points at critical stages to ensure alignment and quality.
*   🛠️ **Customizable Framework:** Easily adaptable prompts and documentation templates to suit specific project needs and coding standards.

## ⚙️ How It Works: The Agentic Flow

Agentic Coding Framework operates on the principle of "Agentic Coding Logic," a structured methodology that guides AI agents through distinct development phases. The process is typically orchestrated by an `AutoPilot` script ([01_AutoPilot.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc)vokes a series of detailed prompts.

1.  **Initialization & Idea Capture:** The user provides an initial idea, which the AI refines through targeted questions.
2.  **Market Research:** The AI, acting as a market analyst, researches the idea's viability using integrated tools.
3.  **Core Concept Definition:** The idea is further refined into a solid concept based on market insights.
4.  **PRD Generation:** A comprehensive Product Requirements Document is created.
5.  **Technical Documentation & Specs:** Existing documentation templates within the project (in `.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/` and `.cursor/rules/03__SPECS/`) are updated by the AI with project-specific details derived from the PRD. This includes architecture, coding conventions, feature specs, etc. The AI is guided by [AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Documentation/AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.mdc).
6.  **Task Management:** The PRD and specs are broken down into a detailed task list ([tasks.json](.cursor/rules/tasks/tasks.json) orchestrator, following the workflow defined in [Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.mdc).
7.  **Implementation:** AI coding agents take the structured tasks and specifications to build the project.
8.  **Testing:** The implemented features are thoroughly tested against specifications (using logic from `[08_Testing.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/08_Testing.mdc)`).
9.  **Deployment:** The validated application is deployed to the production environment (using logic from `[09_Deployment.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/09_Deployment.mdc)`).

For a deeper dive into the underlying logic and phase-by-phase execution, please refer to [logic.mdc](.cursor/rules/logic.mdc) and the detailed roadmap below.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fork this Repository:** This creates your project's dedicated workspace.
2.  **Configure MCP Servers & API Keys:**
    *   The file [MCP-Server.json](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json) lists the MCP servers used.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Replace placeholder API keys (e.g., `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE`) with your actual keys.
    *   **SECURITY BEST PRACTICE:** Do **NOT** commit actual API keys directly. Copy [MCP-Server.json](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json) to a local, gitignored file (e.g., `mcp_config.json`) and configure your AI agent (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf) to use this local file.
3.  **Customize Core Guidelines (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Edit [AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.mdc](.cursor/rules/02__AI-DOCS/Documentation/AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.mdc). This document is *paramount* for guiding the AI's coding style, architectural choices, and overall behavior. Tailor it to your project's specific needs.
4.  **Initiate the Workflow:**
    *   Open your AI agent (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf).
    *   Run the following prompt:
        ```
        Read the full codebase and let's get started with `.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/00_Getting_Started.mdc`
        ```
    *   Alternatively, for a fully automated run, start with [01_AutoPilot.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc).

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [00_Getting_Started.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/00_Getting_Started.mdc).

Existing documents (`[project_prd.mdc](.cursor/rules/projet/PRD_template/project_prd.mdc)`, [tasks.json](.cursor/rules/tasks/tasks.json), etc.) are updated.

This roadmap outlines the ideal flow. The AI agent is designed to be proactive, but the "Core Operational Rules" in [01_AutoPilot.mdc](.cursor/rules/01__AI-RUN/01_AutoPilot.mdc) require it to seek clarification for ambiguities and report errors, ensuring the user remains the ultimate supervisor.

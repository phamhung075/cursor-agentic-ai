# Complex Rule System Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Complex Rule System (CRS) will replace the current rule engine to provide sophisticated rule processing capabilities for the Cursor AI Automation Framework. It will enhance the current string-based pattern matching with semantic understanding, rule relationships, dynamic resolution, and extensibility through plugins.

## Key Components
Based on the task complexity analysis, the implementation plan is organized into the following major components:

### 9. Integration with External Systems (Complexity: MEDIUM)
This component integrates the CRS with TaskMaster, Context Management System, IDE, and external tools.

**Subtasks:**
1. Implement TaskMaster integration
2. Create context management system connectors
3. Build IDE integration
4. Develop external tool adapters

**Dependencies:** Context-Aware Processing Engine, Plugin System Architecture, Resolution and Transformation Engines

## Technical Dependencies
- AST parser libraries for supported languages (TypeScript Compiler API, etc.)
- Graph processing libraries for rule relationships
- TaskMaster integration for task coordination
- Context Management System for sharing context

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing rule files
- Should minimize performance impact during development
- Must operate within the Cursor IDE environment
- Should respect existing system architecture

## Performance Targets
- Process standard files (up to 10,000 LOC) within 200ms
- Support incremental processing for large files
- Scale to projects with up to 1 million LOC
- Handle rule sets with up to 500 rules efficiently

## Risk Management
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AST parsing performance issues | High | Implement caching and incremental parsing |
| Complex rule interactions causing conflicts | Medium | Develop robust conflict resolution algorithms |
| Backward compatibility challenges | Medium | Create compatibility layer for existing rules |
| Language-specific parsing challenges | Medium | Focus on core languages first, then expand |
| Plugin system security concerns | High | Implement sandbox environment for plugins |

## Success Metrics
